PuMuKIT2 Moodle Bundle
=======================

Bundle based on [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) to work with the [PuMuKIT2 Video Platform](https://github.com/campusdomar/PuMuKIT2/blob/2.1.x/README.md).

PumukitMoodleBundle allows to share PuMuKIT2 videos whitin a Moodle.
To accomplish this, the Moodle server also requires the installation of
the PuMoodle tool. This tool consists of a Moodle module, a Moodle repository and
a Moodle filter.

PuMoodle tool is available at this same bundle in [Resources/data/pumoodle/README.md](Resources/data/pumoodle/README.md).
